This folder contains notebooks which reproduce our results, as well as some basic examples of how to use the code and some correctness tests.

greater_than_task.ipynb: reproduce the results for the greater-than task (it's recommended to start here since this task has the fewest complications)

docstring_task_analysis.ipynb: similar to above, for different dataset, model, and task objective

IOI_analysis_visualization.ipynb: includes some visualizations of the CD-T results on the IOI dataset; performs a partially manual circuit discovery and reproduces the heatmaps found in the paper

IOI_automated_circuit_discovery.ipynb: contains a similar analysis, as well as some cells which implement a fully automated circuit discovery pipeline


faithfulness_eval.ipynb: reproduce the comparison graphs
